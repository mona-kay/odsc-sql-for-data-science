# SQL for Data Science at ODSC

## Overview

Thank you for signing up for SQL for Data Science! I look forward to supporting you in your efforts to kickoff your data science career using SQL. The following sections include information about the tools we'll be using and steps to setup _before_ starting our session on Tuesday. Please feel free to reach out if you have any difficulties.

## Tools
### Dataset
For this session, you will be evaluating information in the publicly available [Global Powerplant Database](http://datasets.wri.org/dataset/globalpowerplantdatabase). This data set is available from the linked website as a csv file, and has been converted into a relational database for the purpose of this tutorial.

### SQLite3
We'll be accessing the above database using SQLite3, since it's one of the easiest SQL databases to set up and use in your local environment. It's designed for easy database file access and retrieval of information without needing to connect to an existing database on a server. Essentially, it's designed as a tool for those getting started using SQL.

## Setup

**1. Download the repository for this session from Github [here](https://github.com/mona-kay/odsc-sql-for-data-science).**
All of the files you need for this workshop will be available at this link. Additionally, at the end of our session, I will upload the slides and list of activities with their solutions. The key files you should be reading are the `README.md` for instructions and the `global_powerplants.db` database file.

**2. Download and install [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).**
Please follow the installation instructions for your operating system (i.e., Windows, Mac) [here](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/) **ahead of our session on Tuesday**. Additionally, I will be providing all instructions throughout this workshop using **SQLite Studio**, so I recommend downloading and setting up this interface as well.

We'll be accessing data from the `global_powerplants.db` SQLite3 database file. Once you set up SQLite3, try opening this database file and see if you can access the tables.

**3. Read and test out [these SQLite commands](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-commands/) using the `global_powerplants.db` file.**
The linked tutorial walks you through how to access a SQLite database at the command line. Try these basic commands using the `global_powerplants.db` to see if you experience any issues.


Please contact me if you have any questions or problems setting up! I'm looking forward to meeting you and working with you this coming week!
